  abstract = {Our long-term goal is to develop autonomous robotic systems that have the cognitive abilities of humans, including communication, coordination, adapting to novel situations, and learning through experience. Our approa  ch rests on the integration of the Soar cognitive architecture with both virtual and physical robotic systems. Soar has been used to develop a wide variety of knowledge-rich agents for complex virtual environments, including dist  ributed training environments and interactive computer games. For development and testing in robotic virtual environments, Soar interfaces to a variety of robotic simulators and a simple mobile robot. We have recently made signif  icant extensions to Soar that add new memories and new non-symbolic reasoning to Soar's original symbolic processing, which improves Soar abilities for control of robots. These extensions include mental imagery, episodic and sema  ntic memory, reinforcement learning, and continuous model learning. This paper presents research in mobile robotics, relational and continuous model learning, and learning by situated, interactive instruction.
