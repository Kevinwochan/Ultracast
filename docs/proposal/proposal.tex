\section{User Stories}

\subsection{Product Backlog}

The 29 user stories which make up the product backlog, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:backlog}, were grouped into three categories as described in the sections \ref{sec:project_objectives_stories}, \ref{sec:system_stories} and \ref{sec:novel_features_stories}.
Screenshots of the stories which make up the backlog can be found in sections \ref{sec:project_objectives_stories}, \ref{sec:system_stories} and \ref{sec:novel_features_stories}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Project Objectives Stories} \label{sec:project_objectives_stories}

The project objective stories were derived directly from the project objectives. These JIRA stories can be found in Figure \ref{fig:jira_stories} below.

\end{figure}

The mapping of each project objective to the final user story was summarised in Table \ref{table:project_objectives_to_stories}.

\begin{table}

    \end{tabular}
    
\end{table}


\subsubsection{System Stories} \label{sec:system_stories}

The system stories were designed to address common features offered by existing offerings in the same problem domain. 
They can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:jira_system_user_stories} below.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{resources/system_stories}
    \caption{JIRA System User Stories}
    \label{fig:jira_system_user_stories}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Novel Features Stories} \label{sec:novel_features_stories}

The novel feature user stories, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:jira_novel_user_stories}, were designed to create desirable features that are either uncommon or not 
available in other mainstream offerings in the same problem domain.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{resources/novel_stories}
    \caption{JIRA Novel User Stories}
    \label{fig:jira_novel_user_stories}
\end{figure}

    \caption{Comparison of novel features with competitiors}
    \label{table:comparison_features}
    \bigskip
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c}
        \hline

        \hline
        UL-25           &               &               \\

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sprints}

The sprint planning will occur on Thursdays and the sprint duration will be exactly 
one week as seen in Table \ref{fig:sprint_dates}.

\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \caption{Sprint Dates}
    \label{table:sprint_dates}
    \bigskip
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Week} & \textbf{Sprint Start} & \textbf{Sprint End} \\ \hline
    3-4           & 01/10/20              & 08/10/20            \\ \hline
    4-5           & 08/10/20              & 15/10/20            \\ \hline
    5-6           & 15/10/20              & 22/10/20            \\ \hline
    6-7           & 22/10/20              & 29/10/20            \\ \hline
    7-8           & 29/10/20              & 05/10/20            \\ \hline
    8-9           & 05/10/20              & 12/10/20            \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Relatively few stories were selected for the first sprint, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:first_sprint}
as there will be a decent amount ofwork in setting up the project infastructure. 
The sprints that were selected were those thatfocused on creating the data models 
(e.g. a podcast schema) which will be used later on byother stories, such as UL-2 
(search for podcasts).

\section{Interface and Flow Diagrams}

\section{System Architecture}

The proposed system architecture can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:SysArch}.
It can be seen that our end users will be podcast listeners and content creators.
First, we will use MongoDB to store our data, a NoSQL database that is popular for its high scalability.
This service will be interfaced with the MongoDB-Python driver, available on the MongoDB website.
Next, we will be using Flask for our web-server: a micro-framework that allows us to quickly develop an MVP solution.
Flask is written in Python, so connecting to the database via the MongoDB-Python driver should be straightforward.
Additionally, we will have a recommendation service that will generate recommended podcasts based on the users listening history.
Finally, we will have a React frontend application that will enable our users to login, search and play podcasts, and get recommendations on ones they may be interested in.
The React application and Flask application will communicate through a GraphQL API: a scalable alternative to the popular REST API.

The architecture has been designed with the final demonstration in mind, hence, the business and presentation layers are shown to be hosted on the VLab machine.
Currently, MongoDB is not supported by Debian 6 (the Linux environment on the VLab machine), so we have opted to put the data layer onto an AWS EC2 instance.
