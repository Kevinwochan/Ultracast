# Meeting 17-09-2020

## Apologies

No apologies.

## Minutes

- Went over what tech stack we should use and decided on **React + Python + Mongo**
- MongoDB might change later down the track if it doesn't suit our needs
- Briefly discussed what the recommendation system should look like
  - We all agreed to do a simple tags + ratings system first, then move to a more complex system
  - Dan estimated that we could have the naive approach finished by Week 4/5
- Agreed on meeting times outside of tutorials:
  - Tues 8 - 9am
  - Wed 6 - 7pm
- If the Wednesday meeting is unecessary, then we can scale it back for Week 4.
