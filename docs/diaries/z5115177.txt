You should also include in this diary the following information (if applicable)
about the project progress:

- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry - what was finished 
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
  progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the
  project is not endangered
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)

Week 1

Group was formed and the project selected (ultracast) and meeting times
established. I was selected to be on the backend team. I completed a draft
of the user stories and aim to have them finialised next week as well as
consider possible system architecture solutions.

Week 2

The user stories draft were reviewed at the Tuesday meeting and the tech
stack / system architecture finalised at the Thursday meeting. User stories
were created in JIRA with points and labels assigned. Next week I aim to
complete the user story part of the report. Stories UL-31, UL-32 and UL-33
planned for next sprint.

Week 3

Finished the user story section for the project proposal. Also set up
a basic flask app (UL-31), setup mongodb on a remote server (UL-32) and
setup a basic working example of graph-ql to connect the remote mongodb
instance to the backend webserver (UL-33). JIRAs for next sprint are UL-45,
UL-54.
