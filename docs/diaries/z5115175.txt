You should also include in this diary the following information (if applicable) about the
project progress:

- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- what was finished
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
  progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
  not endangered
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)

Week 1

This week, we established meeting times outside of the tutorial class, project objectives, the tech stack we wanted to use and a rough plan for the recommendation system. I was voted to be the Scrum Master, so I setup the Jira account and made a temporary GitHub repo for everyone to work in. The GitHub classroom setup instructions will be out next week, so I plan to move everything in this repo at that point.

Week 2

Over the weekend, Connor made user stories, and during the meeting on Tuesday, we went through and reviewed them. We then finalised the tech stack for our application, and started working on our proposal. I've been given the System Architecture role, and I want to finish it by the end of this week. Finally, I setup GitHub classroom, and moved all of the contents from the temporary repo into the classroom repo.

Week 3

This week, our team finished off the proposal assignment. On Thursday, we assigned roles for our first sprint. The sprint focused on setting up the system architecture (i.e. the Flask application, MonogDB database and React frontend). Furthermore, we wanted to create CRUD operations for podcasts. I wanted to learn GraphQL so I was tasked with setting up the API for it on the frontend side. By next week, I hope to have the GraphQL API finished.

Week 4

This week, we setup our application architecture and GraphQL API. We managed to get podcast uploading working, although it toook longer than expected due to everyone in the group being new to GraphQL. I also worked on a couple of the Frontend pages, including the upload functionality and preview. By next week, I hope to have completed the dashboard and audio player.

Week 5

This sprint, I completed the dashboard and audio player functionality. I also managed to get Canva Pro (via GitHub Student) so that I could download our branding as SVGs. I updated the website with the new branding (and softer colours) and it looks a lot better! Next week, I hope to have completed more operations for the podcast, as well as improve the 'recent podcast' page.
