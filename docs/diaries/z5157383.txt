Week 1:
Met my group for the first time and coordinated our calenders to set up regular meeting times. 
Researched each of the project proposals and agreed with my group to work on the "ultraCast" project. 
Decided on (coarse) roles for group members, I will be a backend dev.
Began researching the tech. stack that will be used for the backend, currently the best option looks to be flask+mongodb with a graphql interface for the frontend.

Week 2:

Held in-depth discussions with the group to decide on:
    - Novel features of the product
    - Key user functionalities
    - Tech stack that will be used

This week, to prepare the proposal, I will be creating flow diagrams of backend functionality.
