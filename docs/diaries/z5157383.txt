Week 1:
Met my group for the first time and coordinated our calenders to set up regular meeting times. 
Researched each of the project proposals and agreed with my group to work on the "ultraCast" project. 
Decided on (coarse) roles for group members, I will be a backend dev.
Began researching the tech. stack that will be used for the backend, currently the best option looks to be flask+mongodb with a graphql interface for the frontend.

Week 2:

Held in-depth discussions with the group to decide on:
    - Novel features of the product
    - Key user functionalities
    - Tech stack that will be used

This week, to prepare the proposal, I will be creating flow diagrams of backend functionality.

Week 3:

This week, I focused on finishing up the project proposal. I created some tables comparing our proposed solution to existing solutions. I also formatted the document in Latex and proofread it.
Besides this, I designed a basic implementation of our mongodb database schema this week.

Week 4:

This week, I refined the mongodb database schema designed in week 3 and created graphql queries and mutations for the database.
This took much more time than expected because of the number of libraries involved and the lack of documentation for some libraries 
(looking at you graphene_mongo!)
I also setup the graphql multi-part upload spec to allow clients to upload podcasts to the database.
