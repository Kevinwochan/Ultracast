Week 1:
Met my group for the first time and coordinated our calenders to set up regular meeting times. 
Researched each of the project proposals and agreed with my group to work on the "ultraCast" project. 
Decided on (coarse) roles for group members, I will be a backend dev.
Began researching the tech. stack that will be used for the backend, currently the best option looks to be flask+mongodb with a graphql interface for the frontend.
