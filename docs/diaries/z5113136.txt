You should also include in this diary the following information (if applicable) about the
project progress:

- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- what was finished
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
  progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
  not endangered
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)

Week 1: 
This week we decided on the project we wanted to tackle, planned a time everyone was availble for weekly standups and sprints, organised the group into teams (frontend and backend) and voted a Scrum Master.
Next week we plan on completing the project proposal requirements (breaking down functionaity into user stories and researching existing software we can leverage)
