The contents of the file should be brief but clear.
You should include in this diary the following information (if applicable) about the project progress:
- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- what was finished
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)


Week 1

During this week, we met as a team and decided our group name, the project we would work on (ultraCast), and assigned a scrum master. We discussed our interpretation of certain parts of the project spec - particularly how recommendations to the end user would work, and how that could be implemented. We plan on asking questions about this at the tutorial next week. I set up a when2meet link to help the team to find regular times to meet throughout the week, and we settled on Tuesday 8am, Wednesday 6pm (optional) and Thursday 3pm.

In the coming week, we plan on each reading the project spec and assessment summary more closely, defining all of the user stories, and making a start on other parts of the project proposal. These other parts will decided our Tuesday meeting in Week 2, once we have all read the spec more closely.


Week 2
