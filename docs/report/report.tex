% Mentioned in Report Description but not clearly mapped to a section in marking critieria?
%1. Proper references and brief descriptions of ALL third-party functionalities (clouds/services/APIs/libraries/code) used by the team, with justification for their use and discussion how their licensing terms impact results of this project.

\section{Overview}
\subsection{System Architecture}

% TODO nice diagram and high level explaination

% + justification on why this design was selected

\section{Functionalities and Implementation Challenges}

\subsection{Functionalities}
% TODO - Descriptions of the functionalities developed by the team and how they map/address all project objectives
% TODO - how to nicely achieve the above + explain implementation challenges (which may span across multiple objectives)

\subsection{System Implementation}


\subsection{Challenges}
% For implementation challenges every choice needs to be justified  

\section{User Manual}

\subsection{Software Setup Instructions}

% TODO run dis shell script plz

\subsection{Site Usage and Functionality Guide}
% Keep in mind this section is worth 50%

% Extra subsection per story / functionality? Might group some together

% Each person has to demo a set of features for the final demo, it might make sense for each
% person to add to the manual for the features they are demoing.
%      - NOTE: We should agree of how these instrustions are laid out (+ how images are displayed) tho so things are uniform
%      - Might have one person do it earlier / set the standard for everyone else to follow
