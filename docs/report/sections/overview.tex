\subsection{Introduction}

With over 100 million monthly listeners\cite{musicoomph} and a steadily increasing user base, there is no doubt that podcasts are a greatly enriching source of information and entertainment for a large variety of individuals.

Although they are highly valuable, it can be difficult to find podcasts that are of interest to a particular user amidst the 1 million\cite{musicoomph} that are already available.
Thus, podcast streaming services (such as UltraCast) have been created, to provide a centralised place for exploring and discovering new podcasts that are valuable to the listener.

However, all of the web based podcast streaming services available lack many important features, and their interfaces leave much to be desired. For example, there is no streaming service that allows the user to bookmark certain parts of a podcast, nor take notes at certain timestamps. It is even difficult to find a service that allows the listener to change the playback speed of the podcast.

UltraCast combines all of the most important features together into a single package with a web-based podcast streaming service.

UltraCast differentiates itself from competitors by allowing users to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Follow friends to see what they have been listening to
    \item Create \textit{Streams} of podcasts to find interesting podcasts
    \item Create bookmarks inside podcast episodes
    \item Monitor episode and podcast play metrics
\end{itemize}
