\subsection{Functionalities}

The subsections below describe the functionalities of UltraCast broken down into 5
major functionality groupings. Each functionality is directly connected to a User Story,
defined in the Proposal, as well as a project objective if it addresses it. The colour 
schema defined in \cref{tab:func_table_colours} was used for functionalities in  
\cref{tab:func_viewing_and_searching,tab:func_playing_episode,tab:func_recommend_and_follow,tab:func_creator,tab:func_subscribe}.

% Implementation (justify why we‚Äôve chosen GraphQL and MongoDB)
% Engingeering capability (reliability, scalability, consistency)
\subsection{System} \label{ssec:system}
\subsubsection{GraphQL}
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling these queries. It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, with a type system to ensure that apps can only make logical requests - providing clear and helpful errors when necessary. This works to improve the reliability of any solution built upon it.

GraphQL queries also return predictable results by allowing clients to define the structure of the data required; the queries supply exactly what a client asks for and nothing more. This ensures the speed and stability of the apps built using GraphQL, since the app itself controls the data it receives instead of the server. GraphQL also comes with a powerful developer GUI that allows you to visualise exactly what data your API has available. It also highlights potential errors in test queries and leverages code intelligence to make helpful suggestions on how to fix them.

GraphQL is naturally scalable, as any type or amount of data can be contained inside a single query. New queries can be developed on the fly and existing queries can be modified all without breaking existing functionality.

\subsubsection{MongoDB}
MongoDB is a document database designed to be used in the development of scalable applications using agile methodologies. MongoDB naturally supports rapid iterative development, which fits the nature of this project perfectly. It scales to high levels of read and write traffic and to a massive database size, and can easily evolve the type of deployment as necessary; removing roadblocks to development if the structure of our solution changes. As MongoDB relies on JSON files to store data, the structure of the information is under the control of the developer. Developers can adjust and reformat the database as the application evolves with ease - further supporting the RAD approach.

    \subsection{Implementation Challenges}

    \subsubsection{Backend Stack} \label{sssec:backend_challenges}

    The backend of UltraCast employs an unusual technology stack, with MongoDB as a persistence layer, flask as a webserver framework and graphql (via graphene and graphene-mongo libraries) as an API layer.
    This created difficulties in implementing common web-app functionalities due to (1) a lack of documentation on the libraries being used and (2) no online examples implementing these functionalities with this stack.

    \paragraph{User Authentication}

    Implementing user authentication for the backend was a non-trivial task because the Graphene and Graphene-Mongo libraries which are used for the API layer do not natively support this functionality.
    A major challenge in applying general purpose authentication libraries, for example flask-jwt\footnote{Available at https://github.com/mattupstate/flask-jwt}, is that only one route is used for all API calls.
    Some of these API calls need to be authenticated e.g. deleting a podcast where others should not be e.g. signing up to the site.
    The Flask-GraphQL-Auth library\footnote{Available at https://github.com/NovemberOscar/Flask-GraphQL-Auth} provides the required authentication methods, however, it is not actively maintained.
    After much research, user authentication was implemented using the flask-jwt-extended library\footnote{Available at https://github.com/vimalloc/flask-jwt-extended}.
    This library allows authentication to be required on a per-function level, rather than for an entire route.
    Hence, certain mutations and queries can be protected with user authentication where required.
    The frontend calls a signin mutation which returns a Json Web Token (JWT).
    This mutation does not require authentication.
    The frontend then stores this JWT as a cookie and sends it in the header of any future GraphQL API requests.

    \paragraph{Resolving Nested Queries} 

    While testing the frontend, it was discovered that some backend GraphQL queries were taking upwards of one minute to return.
    The site was still responsive, however it took a long time for recommended podcasts to be displayed.
    Further investigation revealed that where nested references were used in the database models, and the GraphQL query involved dereferencing these references, the Graphene-Mongo library would perform one database operation per parent node.
    These database operations are performed sequentially. 
    Since the MongoDB instance is hosted in the cloud, each database operation takes some number of milliseconds due to network latency.
    When a large number of parent nodes were fetched, this resulted in very slow queries.
    It was not feasible to modify the Graphene-Mongo libary to issue less database operations.
    Hence, the decision was made to move the GraphQL API webserver to the same cloud container as the MongoDB instance.
    This improved the time for some queries from over fourty seconds to less than a second.

    \paragraph{Database Integrity}

    \paragraph{Populating the Site}

    To build a meaningful recommendation system, the website must have a reasonable amount of podcasts already uploaded to it.
    Since UltraCast has not been released, there are no users to generate this data.
    To allow for experimentation with different approaches to recommending podcasts to users, a podcast dataset was scraped.
    It was difficult to find a suitable dataset that contained the required category, sub-category and keyword tags for podcasts that did not impose commercial obligations on UltraCast (due to terms of use of the dataset).
    A dataset which is an aggregation of public domain podcasts was found and scraped, providing over 200 podcasts and 2000 podcast episodes for the site.
